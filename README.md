This is intended as a possible functional site for Kodcentrum.se to utilize. 
At the time it is just me MarcusOnline97 and Bitpaw working on this site. 

The scope is very great and we have a continual scope to maintain and improve upon the site.
Here is a list following features we wish to entail.

1.Roles: Having a set variety of user roles.

1.1: Developer/Administrator = Consists of developers who work on the site and make adjustments and changes to improve on what may be needed.

1.2: SuperUser = This role is for the lead of Kodcentrum to use and manage the ranks of their volontary members and coworkers to add more courses and code information.

1.3: Contributer = This role is mainly intended of being able of adding pages and code courses. (Not allowed to remove pages as a security feature)

1.4: Course Access = This is a role intended mainly for volonteers who can get special access to hidden courses which can contain special material intended for courses that are planned out in advance. 

1.5: Regular Member = This role is for the visitors where they can create an account and subscribe to the site to recieve emails whenever a code course that fits their needs gets posted (This is handled through the use of filters
upon selecting the subscribtion)
Notes: A user can always disable their subscription and terminating ones account should also remove their information from the internal database.

3. Making the website modular and easy to build up.
2.1: The way we wanna make it modular is to have a set of preset designs a contributor / Superuser can pick between and then after filling in the information the first page. A box with a plus sign will appear where the user can select
from a multitude of options, from a text file to a code block, to a youtube inbedment, image (jpg / PNG) , textblock or some other form of media input. Once it has been added it's possible for the user to Edit and Delete their page. 
2.2: Every course will have a preset of information that most be required such as a code language, educator, subject and which field in IT this serves.
Notes: I believe that this can be a useful way to allow SuperUsers and Contributors to push out more content for the site itself and make it sustainable.

4. Limitations:
   
5. Roadmap: This site is intended to allow users of various ages with a goal of a young demographic however we want to also provide a good roadmap for young and upcoming developers who want to find out where they need to go in order to
grow as a developer and eventually reach a job position.
5.1: Game Development:
   
5.2 Software Development:
